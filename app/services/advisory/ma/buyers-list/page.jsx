                        answer: "While you can find some potential buyers online, a professional list is built using access to premium M&A databases, industry networks, and deep analysis. We vet for financial capacity and strategic fit, identify the correct decision-makers, and ensure a confidential, structured approach that saves you time and increases the likelihood of a successful transaction."

                        answer: "A strategic buyer is typically another company in your industry (e.g., a competitor, supplier, or customer) looking for synergies, market share, or technology. A financial buyer is an investment firm, like a private equity group, that is primarily focused on the return on investment (ROI) they can generate from your business."

                        question: "How do you ensure confidentiality when creating the list?",
                        answer: "This entire process is conducted with the utmost discretion. We do not contact any potential buyers at this stage. The list is researched and compiled internally and delivered directly and only to you. It serves as your strategic roadmap for future, confidential outreach."
