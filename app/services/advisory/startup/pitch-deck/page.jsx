                p1="The average investor spends just 3-5 minutes reviewing a pitch deck before making a decision. Your deck must immediately communicate your value proposition, demonstrate market opportunity, and show clear potential for returns. Generic templates and one-size-fits-all approaches fail because they don' t address the specific concerns and evaluation criteria of professional investors."

                p3="Clear Problem: Demonstrating a real, urgent problem that customers will pay to solve. Scalable Solution: Showing how your product/service can grow without proportional cost increases. Large Market: Proving significant total addressable market with accessible segments. Strong Team: Highlighting management's ability to execute and scale the business. Traction: Evidence of market validation, early customers, or key partnerships. Financial Returns: Projected metrics that justify the investment and show clear exit potential."

                        answer: "The ideal pitch deck is 12-15 slides for the main presentation, with additional appendix slides for detailed data. This keeps the core presentation focused while providing supporting materials for deeper questions."

                    {
                        question: "What's the most important slide in a pitch deck?",
                        answer: "The problem/solution slide is crucial as it immediately establishes market need. However, the financial projections slide is often what investors scrutinize most closely, so both require exceptional attention to detail."

                        answer: "We research your target investors' portfolio, investment thesis, and decision criteria. Angel investors focus more on team and market, while VCs emphasize scalability and returns. We adjust emphasis and language accordingly."

                    {
                        question: "What if I need to present to different audiences with the same deck?",
                        answer: "We create flexible decks with modular sections that can be easily adapted. The core narrative remains consistent, but we can adjust technical depth, financial detail, and market focus based on your audience."
